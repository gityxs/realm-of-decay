Future Updates

The Store
---------

 - A combination of currency and scrap can be used to increase a weapon's quality tier. This should be very costly on the scrap front.
 - A small number of weapons will be available in the store for purchase with currency.

Naming
 - The following things should be named:
   - The player (decide on game start, can be changed at any time)
   - Enemies
     - Selected from a list based on weapon type and boss status
     - Rarely choose from a list of special names (including contributing Redditors)

Story (low priority)
 - Some way of motivating the player to actually play the game.
